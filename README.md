# FBU Final Project - 2019

**Freshtable** is a grocery management app created to help users keep track of the groceries they buy and their expiry dates.


Built as the final project for my internship at Facebook in 2019.

## Goal
The goal of the project was to help combat household food waste by alerting users and sending them recipe recommendations for ingredients that were about to expire.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
